 * Changes to app structure and definition
 * There's no longer just one main.js file.
 * This release splits up the bundle into three parts.
 * browser.js, node.js and native.js.
 * Each part is optimized for their namesake platform.
 *
 * There's also a standalone back button callback that was added
 * called navGoBack which abstracts away the back button action
 * for different platforms

 * SDK now supports phoenix backend.
 * 2 versions of SDK now exist, one for Skedulo Classic, one for Skedulo Phoenix.
 * This release includes new testing features for custom forms that
 * can be used when testing forms locally.
 * These features include the ability to mimic Skedulo X offline compatability,
 * test with an instance of Condenser and test with extra debugging output.
 *
 * There's also support for handling the Android native back button within Skedulo X.
